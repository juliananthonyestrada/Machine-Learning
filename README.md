# 🧠 Machine Learning Roadmap — From Beginner to Expert

Welcome to my self-paced Machine Learning Roadmap! This repository is a hands-on, structured learning project where I implement and document machine learning models from scratch, one model at a time.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Build a deep understanding of each ML model from first principles
- Practice coding clean and reusable implementations
- Develop intuition through experimentation and visualization
- Create a resource I can revisit, share, and extend over time

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each machine learning model has its own folder containing:

- `README.md` — Overview and theory of the model
- `notebook.ipynb` — Interactive implementation and experiments
- `model.py` — Reusable implementation code
- `data/` — Sample dataset used for testing the model

---

## 🧭 Learning Framework

For each model, I answer a consistent set of questions to guide understanding:

1. **What problem does this model solve?**
2. **What type of data does it expect?**
3. **What are the assumptions behind it?**
4. **What is the mathematical foundation?**
5. **How does the model learn from data?**
6. **How does it make predictions?**
7. **What are its hyperparameters, and how do I tune them?**
8. **How do I evaluate its performance?**
9. **What are real-world applications of this model?**
10. **How is this model deployed in practice?**
11. **When should I use or avoid this model?**
